            <p>
                I'm a web developer that enjoys watching cats. Not the movie or the theatrical play but actually cute cats.
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy good food as well</p>

            <h4>Why I enjoy programming</h4>
            <ul>
                <ol>
                    It stimulates the brain.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Its like math that is understandable.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    I enjoy it because its like a puzzle that keeps on getting solved a bit by bit. I enjoy the challenge that comes with it.
                </ol>
            </ul>
