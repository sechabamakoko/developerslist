                I'm a web developer, ....
            </p>
            <p>I am a small town girl, who is passionate about software development. I am inspired to make my mark 
                in this male dominated industry, and hope to be an inspiration to young black felames from my community. I aim to 
                support and increase the number of women in technology by equipping young women with the necessary computing skills to pursue 
                 21st century opportunities.
